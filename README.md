# Banish Brooks
A browser extension to hide the NYT Op-Ed section

Banish Brooks puts the NYT opinion pages out of sight (site) and out of mind. 
The extension not only removes any navigation links to the NYT opinion section itself, 
it also colors any internal links to opinion pieces a light gray (warning you to stay away). 
In the unfortunate event that you happen to click on a link to a NYT opinion article, fear not: 
Banish Brooks will safely redirect you back to the NYT homepage, unscathed.
